cocaine-http-proxy (0.3.11) trusty; urgency=low

  * Changed: format trace id as a hex.
    Change `trace_id` attribute formatting, making it hex to be able to
    properly match our Cocaine traces in a single format.
    The old unformatted trace attribute is now formatted using `trace`.
    Moreover this commit removes `request_id` attribute, as it is no longer
    needed.
