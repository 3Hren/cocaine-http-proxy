cocaine-http-proxy (0.3.14) trusty; urgency=low

  * Changed: improved the speed of invocation events by eliminating a pair of
    unnecessary heap allocations.
  * Changed: update cocaine version that fixes an UB which forbids us to use
    latest nightly compilers.
  * Changed: reuse locator connection. This change forces the proxy to reuse
    a single locator (per thread) for resolving all services. This saves a
    tons of fds (basically almost by twice).
  * Fixed: fix a bug where in the case of equal logger names their filters
    affect each other.
  * Deps: update to futures 0.1.15.
  * Deps: drop `rpmv` dependency.

cocaine-http-proxy (0.3.12) trusty; urgency=low

  * Added: tracing policy header.
    This commit allows to manually specify whether a request should be
    traced verbosely using `X-Cocaine-Tracing-Policy` header.
    It allows `Auto` value to fall back to default dice rolling policy as
    like as specifying real value in [0; 1] range to calculate trace bit
    chance.
    For example `X-Cocaine-Tracing-Policy: 1.0` forces the request to be
    fully traced.

cocaine-http-proxy (0.3.11) trusty; urgency=low

  * Changed: format trace id as a hex.
    Change `trace_id` attribute formatting, making it hex to be able to
    properly match our Cocaine traces in a single format.
    The old unformatted trace attribute is now formatted using `trace`.
    Moreover this commit removes `request_id` attribute, as it is no longer
    needed.
